/-- `Rep A m` means `m` is a sum of **finitely many** elements of `A`
    (i.e., representable by *some* finite number of terms, not a fixed order). -/
def Rep (A : Set ℕ) (m : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ k : ℕ, ∃ f : Fin k → ℕ, (∀ i, f i ∈ A) ∧ (∑ i : Fin k, f i) = m

/-- Integers **not** representable as a finite sum of elements of `A` **while avoiding** `n`. -/

/-- An asymptotic additive basis is minimal when one cannot obtain an asymptotic
additive basis by removing any element from it. -/
def MinAsymptoticAddBasis (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  IsAsymptoticAddBasis A ∧ ∀ n ∈ A, ¬ IsAsymptoticAddBasis (A \ {n})

/--
Suppose $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ is a minimal basis with positive density.
Is it true that, for any $n \in A$, the (upper) density of integers which 
cannot be represented without using $n$ is positive?
