Formalisation note: the next 5 formalisations are an attempt at capturing the question "how does
$f(n)$ grow?". In addition to trivial solutions (e.g. setting `answer(sorry) = 0` in some of these),
it is possible that some of these admit easy solutions that shouldn't count as genuine solutions.
As usual in this repo, solving this problem is not simply providing a term to replace `answer(sorry)`
together with a proof of the theorem, but providing a *mathematically interesting* answer.
Note also that there might be other reasonable (and non equivalent) formal statements that capture this
question.
Similar remarks hold for the `variants.monotone` formalisations later in this file.
