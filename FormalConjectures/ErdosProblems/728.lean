Let $\varepsilon, C > 0$. Are there integers $a, b, n$ such that
$$a > \varepsilon n,\quad b > \varepsilon n, \quad a!\, b! \mid n!\, (a + b - n)!, $$
and
$$ a + b > n + C \log n ?$$

theorem erdos_728 :
    (∀ (ε C : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (hC : 0 < C), ∃ a b n : ℕ,
      ε * n < a ∧
      ε * n < b ∧
      Nat.factorial a * Nat.factorial b ∣ Nat.factorial n * Nat.factorial (a + b - n) ∧
      a + b > n + C * Real.log n) ↔ answer(sorry) := by
  sorry

-- TODO(firsching): Use Legendre's formula to test divisibility in terms of p-adic valuations.
