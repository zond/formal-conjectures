/-- A Sidon sequence (also called a Sidon set) is a sequence of natural numbers $a_0, a_1, ...$
such that all pairwise sums $a_i + a_j$ are distinct for $i ≤ j$.

In other words, all pairwise sums of elements are distinct apart from coincidences forced by the
commutativity of addition. -/
def IsSidon {ι α : Type*} [Preorder ι] [Add α] (a : ι → α) : Prop :=
  ∀ i₁ j₁ i₂ j₂, i₁ ≤ j₁ → i₂ ≤ j₂ → a i₁ + a j₁ = a i₂ + a j₂ → i₁ = i₂ ∧ j₁ = j₂

lemma IsSidon.Injective {ι α : Type*} [Preorder ι] [Add α] (a : ι → α) (ha : IsSidon a) :
    Injective a :=
  fun i₁ i₂ hi ↦ (ha i₁ i₁ i₂ i₂ (le_refl _) (le_refl _) (by rw [hi])).1

If $A ⊆ ℕ$ is a Sidon set then must the complement of $A$ contain an infinite arithmetic
progression?

Answer "yes" proved in:
