/--Is it true that in any finite colouring of the integers there exists a monochromatic solution to `1/a=1/b+1/c` with distinct `a,b,c`?-/
@[problem_status solved]
theorem erdos_303 :
    --For any finite colouring of the integers
    ∀ (𝓒 : ℤ → ℤ), (Set.range 𝓒).Finite →
      --There exists integers `a, b, c`
      ∃ (a b c : ℤ),
      --that are non-zero and distinct.
      [a, b, c, 0].Nodup ∧
      --`a, b, c` satisfy the equation
      (1/a : ℝ) = 1/b + 1/c ∧
      --`a, b, c` have the same color
      (𝓒 '' {a, b, c}).Subsingleton := by
