Are there infinitely many pairs of integers `n≠m` such that $\bimom{2n}{n}$
and $\bimom{2m}{m}$ have the same set of prime divisors?

For example, `(87,88)` and `(607,608)` are such pairs.

Show that for all `n`, the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$ is even.

Show that `(n,n+1) ∈ S` if and only if for all odd primes `p≤n` we have `n∉{(p−1)/2,p−1}(mod p)`.

Standard heuristics then predict there should be `≫ x/(log x)^2`
many `n≤x` such that `(n, n+1) ∈ S`.
